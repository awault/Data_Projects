2,machine-learning,11370,"Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that draws on elements from algorithmic analysis, computational statistics, mathematics, optimization, etc. It is mainly concerned with the use of data to construct models that have high predictive/forecasting ability. Topics include modeling building, applications, theory, etc.
"
46,python,6681,Use for data science questions related to the programming language Python. Not intended for general coding questions (which should be asked on Stack Overflow). 
194,deep-learning,4859,"a new area of Machine Learning research concerned with the technologies used for learning hierarchical representations of data, mainly done with deep neural networks (i.e. networks with two or more hidden layers), but also with some sort of Probabilistic Graphical Models."
81,neural-network,4361,"Artificial neural networks (ANN), are composed of 'neurons' - programming constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons. A set of weighted connections between the neurons allows information to propagate through the network to solve artificial intelligence problems without the network designer having had a model of a real system."
77,classification,3265,An instance of supervised learning that identifies the category or categories which a new instance of dataset belongs.
324,keras,2721,"Keras is a popular, open-source deep learning API for Python built on top of TensorFlow and is useful for fast implementation. Topics include efficient low-level tensor operations, computation of arbitrary gradients, scalable computations, export of graphs, etc."
47,nlp,2714,"Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input, and others involve natural language generation."
128,scikit-learn,2303,"scikit-learn is a popular machine learning package for Python that has simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. Topics include classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing."
321,tensorflow,2185,"TensorFlow is an open source library for machine learning and machine intelligence.  TensorFlow uses data flow graphs with tensors flowing along edges. For details, see https://www.tensorflow.org.  TensorFlow is released under an Apache 2.0 License."
72,time-series,1870,"Time series are data observed over time (either in continuous time or at discrete time periods).
"
157,regression,1591,"Techniques for analyzing the relationship between one (or more) ""dependent"" variables and ""independent"" variables.
"
61,dataset,1497,"A dataset is a collection of data, often in tabular or matrix form.

This tag is NOT intended for data requests (""where can I find a dataset about ..."") --> see OpenData"
24,r,1483,"R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, and graphics."
15,clustering,1392,"Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval etc."
557,cnn,1361,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, also called ConvNets) are a tool used for classification tasks and image recognition.  The name giving first step is the extraction of features from the input data. "
64,pandas,1341,"pandas is a python library for Panel Data manipulation and analysis, e.g. multidimensional time series and cross-sectional data sets commonly found in statistics, experimental science results, econometrics, or finance."
168,predictive-modeling,1183,Statistical techniques used for predicting outcomes.
5,data-mining,1182,"An activity that seeks patterns in large, complex data sets. It usually emphasizes algorithmic techniques, but may also involve any set of related skills, applications, or methodologies with that goal."
527,lstm,1170,LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory. When we use this term most of the time we refer to a recurrent neural network or a block (part) of a bigger network. 
27,statistics,1122,"Statistics is a scientific approach to inductive inference and prediction based on probabilistic models of the data. By extension, it covers the design of experiments and surveys to gather data for this purpose."
54,feature-selection,970,"Methods and principles of selecting a subset of attributes for use in further modelling
"
255,data,861,"Questions mostly concerned with managing data, without focus on pre-processing or modelling."
113,random-forest,848,"Random forest is a machine learning ensemble method based on choosing random subsets of observations and variables for each of many decision trees.
"
619,machine-learning-model,843,"A machine learning model is a simplified representation of a dataset, derived from statistics in the data, used to make predictions. It can represent patterns, behaviours or features within this dataset which have been learnt by the algorithm during training. "
